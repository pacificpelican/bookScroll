[**BookScroll**](http://djmcloud.danieljmckeown.com/bookscroll/) is a template for books on the web by [Dan McKeown](http://danmckeown.info) created in February 2015.  It was forked from the template for [Retirement Planning Like a Dinosaur](http://danmckeown.info/books/retirement/).

It uses the [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) library and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) to power its responsive table-of-contents left side navigation, fonts, and layout tools.

The BookScroll template is licensed (as is Materialize CSS and jQuery) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/79f9c8435b0da7e6f907a54ab3120e5b609d45ee/LICENSE) (or the [GNU GPL v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later).

You can see the changes to the project in the [changelog.md](changelog.md) file and view the markup in the [index.html](index.html) file.

The template includes tags surrounded by double curly brackets {{}} that indicate what would go in that part of the template, for example {{bookTitle}} and {{authorURI}}.  These fields should be replaced by the relevant text, and the sample image should be replaced with an image appropriate to the book being created.

For a fork of this template that uses [Mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js) to put the data into the template, check the [Book Brackets project](http://djmcloud.danieljmckeown.com/bookbrackets/).
